### Escaping Travel Sequences

**Travel sequences**, also known as directory traversal or path traversal, allow an attacker to access files and directories beyond the intended scope of an application. When dealing with travel sequences, it's essential to escape them to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources. 

For example, an improperly escaped travel sequence like `....//....//....//etc/passwd` can potentially grant an attacker access to system files like `/etc/passwd`. Implementing proper input validation and directory traversal prevention measures is crucial to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

### Null Byte Bypass

A **null byte bypass**, often referred to as a null byte injection or null character exploit, can be used to manipulate the behavior of an application when it processes file paths or names. By appending `%00` (the null byte) to the end of a file path, an attacker can truncate the path and potentially access files that were not intended to be accessible.

For instance, `../../../etc/passwd%00.png` could be used to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive files. It's essential for applications to validate and sanitize user inputs effectively, considering the null byte and other special characters, to prevent such bypasses.

Mitigating travel sequence and null byte bypass vulnerabilities is critical for the security of an application, as they can lead to unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive data. Proper input validation and secure coding practices are key to preventing these types of attacks.
