If you have access to the code look for funcs like deserialize and functions like pickled in python based code

If not look for largs blobs of data being transferred, decode them and check if u can alter some value and get results.

For java based deserialization vulns use ysoserial tool

For PHP based gadget deserialization vulns use phpgcc tool
