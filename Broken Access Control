Hunting 
1. Learn about your target application. The more you understand about
the architecture and development process of the web application, the
better you’ll be at spotting these vulnerabilities.
2. Intercept requests while browsing the site and pay attention to sensitive
functionalities. Keep track of every request sent during these actions.
3. Use your creativity to think of ways to bypass access control or otherwise
interfere with application logic.
4. Think of ways to combine the vulnerability you’ve found with other vul-
nerabilities to maximize the potential impact of the flaw.
5. Draft your report! Be sure to communicate to the receiver of the report
how the issue could be exploited by malicious users.
