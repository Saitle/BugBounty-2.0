IDOR are the most common vulnerability which almost every site has and yields a lot of money
Here I wont be talking much abt IDOR vulnerability as this repo doesn'tfocus on actually teaching you a vuln, you can learn about it from here
https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor

I'll be telling you some of the bypasses of IDORs

Encoded IDs and Hashed IDs
https://example.com/messages?user_id=MTIzNg

Check for leaked IDs
It might also be possible that the application leaks IDs via another API end-
point or other public pages of the application

Offer an Application id

GET /api_v1/messages
Host: example.com
Cookies: session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE

GET /api_v1/messages and GET /api_v1/messages?user_id=ANOTHER_USERS_ID

Keep checking for blind IDORs
In this you may not receive a response or get the same on the webpage, but maybe it fired up in your inbox

Change the request method
GET/ to POST/ or POST/ to /GET

Change the Requested File Type
GET /get_receipt?receipt_id=2983 instead GET /get_receipt?receipt_id=2983.json

After you get a hang of IDORs use Burpsuite extensions like Autorize, Automatrix & Autorepeater
